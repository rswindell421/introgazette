<p class="description"> My name is Shareef Swindell and I am currently enrolled at The New York Code + Design Academy in a Part Time Web Development Intensive. My aim is to learn coding and become a web developer because I want to be able to understand the ever changing landscape known as the internet. I am a preschool teacher and a songwriter, when I am not making music I enjoy waching anime, putting together cool outfits and enjoying New York City's nightlife.</p>
